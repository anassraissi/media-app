 <Trending posts={[{id:1},{id:2},{id:3}] ?? []}/>

The ?? operator is the nullish coalescing operator, introduced in JavaScript (ES2020).
It checks if the value on the left side (posts) is null or undefined.
If posts is null or undefined, the operator returns the value on the right side ([]), which is an empty array.
If posts is a valid array (as in this case), the operator returns the original value of posts.
